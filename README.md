# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Models in Python

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **machine learning algorithms** using **Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook**. Each notebook demonstrates end-to-end workflows including **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization**.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

* **Classification Models**

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree Classifier
  * Random Forest
  * NaÃ¯ve Bayes
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM)

* **Regression Models**

  * Linear Regression with Regularization (L1/L2)

* **Clustering Models**

  * K-Means Clustering

* **Model Optimization & Evaluation**

  * Gradient Descent Implementation
  * Hyperparameter Tuning
  * K-Fold Cross Validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

* Hands-on implementation of supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms.
* Clean and modular Jupyter notebooks for easy experimentation.
* Visualization of results using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
* Covers both **theory-based coding (from scratch)** and **library-based approaches (scikit-learn)**.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/machine-learning-models.git
   cd machine-learning-models
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
